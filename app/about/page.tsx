          This website serves to provide you with some recipes to get started with making your own bread at home, without making you look at a bunch of ads or scroll past a 14 paragraph essay about the summers I spent eating bread in Alpena. Thats the last thing I want to read about when I'm hungry is another persons life story. This website does cost a little bit of money to maintain though, and I am between jobs, so if you find that you would like to support us financially please click this link.
